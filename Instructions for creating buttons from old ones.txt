Use the button (bt-template.gif) and copy patterns (breadthwise) till the desired size is reached @96dpi
For the lower row, use bt-template_lower.gif

Put in the text as follows:
Arial Narrow
Regular
10
Strong
Orange (fe9e3e)

On Photoshop CS5, I had to set it up as follows. 
Arial           Narrow
14 pt           Auto
0               0
100%            100%
0 pt            fe9e3e
English: USA    Strong

Make sure the images are saved as GIF files
A good rule of thumb is to reproduce the text from another layer (prefereably in the same column), and then replace it with the new text.
