                            <p align="center"><img border="0" src="/images/the-week/rohini_angel_radhika.jpg" alt="Rohini, Angel and Radhika" align="center" hspace="0" width="540" height="330" /></p>
		                    <p align="justify">The Biophilia hypothesis was developed by Harvard biologist Edward O. Wilson in 1984. It states that early in human history there was an evolutionary advantage in knowing about the natural world, particularly information concerning plants and animals, and that this knowledge contributed to survival. So the human brain has been shaped by evolution to pay selective attention to animals.</p>
							<p align="justify">In some, that part of the brain may be less developed, leading to psychiatric disorders that disturb the capacity of a person to relate to other human beings. Here is where pet therapy or animal-assisted therapy comes in. Therapy animals help to arouse, excite or calm a child or an adult suffering from dementia or other mental disorders. According to the Yerkes-Dodson law (1908), there is an inverted U-shaped function between arousal and performance. Too little arousal has an inert effect on the individual, while too much has a hyperactive effect. You want mid-level arousal for best results.</p>
                            <p align="justify">It has been scientifically proven that petting an animal reduces stress and induces relaxation. The patient would be able to become less anxious during therapy and this would increase his self confidence and result in better performance. According to studies by Friedman in 1983 and Anderson in 1992, pet owners have lower blood pressure, triglyceride and cholesterol levels than non-owners.</p>
                            <p align="justify">If that part of the brain is less developed in some, in others there is a marked development. According to research by the Delta Society, an international non-profit organisation, more people own pets than ever before. Further, people spend more money on pets than they ever have. "You either love pets or you don't", says Mufaddal Tambawala, who can predict the bowel movements of his exotic birds. "There are no two ways about it." Mufaddal, who waited five years to breed one of his Australian birds, says that his birds have taught him patience. Pet psychologist Pooja Sathe-Gawande says that pets mirror their owners. "If the owners are confident and outgoing the pet will also be confident and outgoing", she says.</p>
                            <p align="justify">Many pet owners also vouch for the sixth sense of their pets. Mufaddal says his birds warned him of the earthquake in Mumbai in 2012. Morgan, a Yorkshire terrier, jumped at owner Pamela Plante's leg so incessantly that she finally inspected it in the mirror and realised it was red up to the knee. She was diagnosed with an infection that had spread throughout her body. In the past few years, studies have shown that dogs can sniff out early and late stage lung and breast cancers. The Pine Street Foundation, a non-profit cancer education and research organisation in California, is training dogs to recognise ovarian cancer.</p>
                            <p align="justify">Samira Abraham, owner of a golden retriever in Bangalore, has a little slip of paper pinned to her fridge. It lists 10 lessons your pet can teach you, which includes responsibility and unconditional love. The Biophilia hypothesis might just be that: a hypothesis, but the love and borderline obsession of these pet owners across the country for their pets are very real.</p>
                            <p align="justify"><b>My Persian cats and I</b></p>
                            <p align="center"><img border="0" src="/images/the-week/john_anu_kurien_persian_cats.jpg" alt="John and Anu Kurien with their persian cats" align="center" hspace="0" width="540" height="330" /></p>
                            <p align="justify"><i>'Dear uncle and aunty,<br />My name is Angel Anna Jacob. I study in the eighth standard at Mount Carmel Vidyaniketan school in Kanjikuzhy, Kottayam. I saw a picture of you with your cats in the Malayalam magazine Karshakashree. I love cats. If it's OK with you, can you give me one pair of your Persian kittens? My number is given below.'</i><br /><br />This is a letter John Kurien and his wife, Anu, received a week ago. This is not the first inquiry they are getting. When it comes to cat lovers, they are minor celebrities in their neighbourhood. The couple owns 19 Persian cats, some pure breed, others mixed. They live in Ayemenem in Kottayam.</p>
                            <p align="justify">After 31 years of service in a cement company in Saudi Arabia, John and his wife decided to come to India to enjoy retirement. Accompanying them were two male and two female cats of the Persian long-hair variety. "We had to vaccinate the cats 10 days before travelling and inform the airlines about the cage size and other details", says John.</p>
                            <p align="justify">One of the males died and the other was stolen. Meanwhile, the prettier of the female cats got pregnant by a stray cat. They later bought two Persian cats—one from Bangalore and the other from a Gulf returnee. It is their descendants that now people the couple's house.</p>
                            <p align="justify">John and Anu talk of the cats like they are humans. "The boys when put together fight like mad", he says. "Not that the girls are any better. Take Karambi [pointing to a black cat], she doesn't like being petted by strangers and gets extremely irritable. Sometimes she pouts for many days at a stretch."<br />Some of the cats are kept in a weld mesh and wood cage, the rest in the porch. The spaces between the iron-grilled shutters give the cats access to the outside world. They are fed pressure-cooked chicken marinated in turmeric. Along with this they are also fed 150gm of readymade cat food twice a day.<br />Caring for them occupies the major part of the couple's time. "If we fall sick or have to go somewhere for more than a day, things will not get done", says John. Three of their children are settled abroad and one daughter is slated to get married this year. "In the absence of our children, these cats are there for us to love", he says.</p>
                            <p align="justify"><b>My golden retriever and I</b></p>
                            <p align="center"><img border="0" src="/images/the-week/samira_abraham_golden_retriever.jpg" alt="Samira Abraham and her Golden Retriever" align="center" hspace="0" width="540" height="330" /></p>
                            <p align="justify">When I enter Samira Abraham's apartment in Bangalore, she is chasing a dog around the dining table. Plastic balls, wooden bones and stuffed toys with chewed appendages are strewn around the room. Five minutes later, the dog climbs onto the sofa, panting. "She thinks that if she climbs on the sofa, no one can do anything to her", says Samira.</p>
                            <p align="justify">The culprit is nine-month-old Zoe. Samira and her husband got the dog from a breeder in Bangalore when she was six weeks old. There were three other golden retrievers, but Zoe was the naughtiest. "She came and checked us out. Then she went to a corner of the room and was playing with herself. She was playing hard to get. We fell for her ploy and instantly fell in love with her", says Samira.</p>
                            <p align="justify">Samira has had dogs all her life. They have been an important part of her life. She says she couldn't live without them. "There's also the responsibility factor", says Samira. "You learn to care for another human being at a very young age. Plus, it's good fun to play with them and teach them things." Her first dog was a golden retriever who died when she was three. Golden retrievers are extremely friendly and intelligent dogs.<br />The reason why dogs play a lot when they are pups is because they learn a lot through games. Zoe's favourite games are hide and seek, wrestling and tug-of-war. She also loves it when Samira shows her a treat and then hides it. She then has to use her nose to find it. Sometimes Samira mentions the names of certain toys and makes Zoe bring it to her. When her husband comes home, Zoe waits for him to take off his socks, which she will immediately grab. She wants him to chase her. When the couple argue, Zoe gets in between them and does all sorts of things to prevent them from fighting. "She can be quite a clown at times", says Samira.</p>
                            <p align="justify">In the morning when Zoe gets up, she likes to cuddle. She is very fussy about eating breakfast and taking her medicines. So Samira makes it a game. She pretends like Zoe cannot have her food, which immediately makes her want it. At other times, Samira will sing or dance and entertain Zoe while her husband surreptitiously sneaks the food into her mouth. When the couple go to work, Zoe entertains herself, mainly by chewing on the furniture.</p>
                            <p align="justify">"No matter how late we are, she's always excited to see us", says Samira. "It's a lesson we can learn from dogs. They don't hold grudges or get mad at you. They teach you the meaning of unconditional love."<br />Zoe can also easily sense when Samira is upset. "She'll come and keep giving me handshakes, do stupid things that put a smile on my face", she says. It's quite obvious that the couple's lives revolve around Zoe. That is why they have decided that they will always have dogs, even after Zoe's time.</p>
                            <p align="justify"><b>My pony and I</b><br /><img border="0" src="/images/the-week/gerry_martin_copper.jpg" alt="Gerry Martin and his pony, Copper" align="right" hspace="10" width="270" height="371">Copper the pony lives in a grilled enclosure with four donkeys for companions. Copper, with his thick mane, mostly keeps to himself. He thinks he's too good for the donkeys, says his owner, Gerry Martin, who leans towards him and speaks in a cooing voice. I cannot make out what he is saying, but I hear the word 'sweetheart' several times. Speaking to his pets is a habit he got from his grandfather, he says.</p>
                            <p align="justify">Copper, Gerry says, is an extremely affectionate animal. But he wasn't always so. Four years ago, when he came to the Martins, he had been badly abused. Even today, the scars of deep gashes on his skin are visible. Gerry got the donkeys and Copper from Compassion Unlimited Plus Action. When he first came, no one could go near him. He was skin and bones and extremely aggressive. Today, his greatest companion is Gerry's five-year-old daughter, who loves feeding him bran and oil cakes. Copper as well as the four donkeys - Oscar, Fey, Rocket and Grey - bear the names of characters from Gerry's daughter's story books. Gerry's not sure of Copper's age. "He came to us as an old pony", he says. "Everyone thought he'd survive only for a couple of years but he's been going strong."</p>
                            <p align="justify">Copper lives in a two-acre animal farm in Bangalore with emus, pheasants, cows, sheep and rabbits for company. The farm was started 31 years ago by Gerry's parents. Today, Gerry helps manage it, but he spends most of his time helping schools and individuals get a contextual understanding of conservation issues. He also works on mitigation of human-wildlife conflicts. The biggest one is snakebite. Around 50,000 people die annually in India because of snakebites. Gerry is working with the Centre for Herpetology, Bangalore, and other organisations to find a solution for this.</p>
                            <p align="justify"><b>My birds and I</b></p>
                            <p align="center"><img border="0" src="/images/the-week/mufaddal_tambawala_birds.jpg" alt="Mufaddal Tambawala and his birds" align="center" hspace="0" width="540" height="330" /></p>
                            <p align="justify">To say that Mufaddal Tambawala, chairman of Mayfair Real Estates in Mumbai, is passionate about birds would be an understatement. He knows their mood swings, when they are going to mate, who is not feeling well and who has not eaten. When they are sick, their eyes are a little watery and feathers ruffled. If they are very sick they will tuck their beaks into their wings to retain the warmth. He even knows how to crop feed or directly put the tube into the stomach of the birds to administer antibiotics. From the shape of the egg he knows whether it is going to be a male or a female. He has more than 50 exotic birds of the Rosella and Amazon variety, which he keeps in an enclosed aviary at the back of his house in Bhendi Bazaar.</p>
                            <p align="justify">Birds came into Mufaddal's life at a very early stage. In school, he used to buy pigeons for 020 a pair. He would smuggle them in his school bag or in his shirt. Once he sold his watch to buy pigeons. Another time, he sneaked a basket of pigeons into his neighbour's house and later hauled it into his house with a rope when his parents were not there. He had 30 to 40 pigeons. "My mother used to have a big problem with the birds because instead of studying, I'd be on the terrace feeding or cuddling them. They had a very calming effect on me. They still do", he says. Even then, he had an instinctive understanding of how to train them. "I would rattle a bag of seeds. After some time, whenever they heard the rattle they would come to me", he says.</p>
                            <p align="justify">He moved from pigeons to exotic birds when he bought a hand-tamed cockatoo some years ago. The bird was named Stupid because of his antics. If he wanted a peanut from Mufaddal he would hang upside down on one leg and ask for the peanut with the other. He was extremely possessive of Mufaddal, and hated his wife. In the afternoons, when she would be trying to sleep, he would shriek at the top of his voice. But he could sense when Mufaddal would reach home and would immediately keep quiet, waiting for Mufaddal to come and pet him.</p>
                            <p align="justify">"Birds have an amazing sixth sense", feels Mufaddal. He gives the example of the earthquake in Mumbai. An hour earlier, the birds were frantic. They just wouldn't keep still. It was later that Mufaddal realised they were trying to warn him about the impending earthquake.</p>
                            <p align="justify">He sold Stupid and got a pair of parakeets from a breeder who was leaving the city. Perhaps it was beginner's luck, but the birds bred and a chick was hatched. Later he bought a pair of Rosellas from Crawford Market for Rs8,000. "I realised my fancy was for the Australian species", he says. "They were beautiful birds with a fascinating call." At that time, he was a novice at taking care of birds. He looked it up on the internet and learned their feeding patterns, medication and breeding seasons.</p>
                            <p align="justify">Today 90 per cent of the birds in his aviary have been bred in his house. He retains them to develop new mutations. He says they teach him something new every day but the biggest lesson they have taught is patience. "For example, I had a beautiful male Rosella", he says. "I gave him a female to mate with for five years, but the female would lay infertile eggs. This year, the sixth year, he gave me three beautiful chicks."<br />Collecting birds was an isolated hobby earlier. But Mufaddal helped organise the first bird show at the MET College in 2010, for which he got a verbal thrashing from Maneka Gandhi. People went berserk. </p>
                            <p align="justify">Hobbyists everywhere turned up and began sharing stories of their birds. Mufaddal's phone was ringing constantly. He became a minor celebrity when he, along with his birds, was featured on NDTV and Star News.</p>
                            <p align="justify"><b>Paw balm</b><br /><i>On March 3, Jiyon Ganguly flew from Kolkata to Mumbai with his dog, Simbaa. What was special about this trip was that it was probably the first time in India that an autistic passenger was allowed to board a flight with his therapy dog. It might seem inconsequential to the uninitiated, but it is a giant leap for animal-assisted therapy in India.</i></p>
                            <p align="justify"><i>In the west, AAT was popularised in the 1970s but in India, it is still in its nascent stages. "Mental health itself is an unmentionable topic in India so using an animal to improve mental conditions is absolute taboo", says Rohini Fernandes, who started Animal Angels Foundation in Mumbai in 2005 along with her partner Radhika Nair. Both Rohini and Radhika are clinical psychologists who are certified practitioners of AAT from the University of North Texas, USA.</i></p>
                            <p align="justify"><i>They use AAT to complement conventional therapy like play and behaviour therapy for children and cognitive therapy for adults. "A lot of times, the clients relate their problems to the therapy dogs", says Rohini. They have a team of 15 therapy dogs in different parts of the city. To be used as a therapy dog, the animal must pass a temperament test after which, it is given training in hand signals and verbal commands for six months. Rohini and Radhika work in special schools, rehab centres for adults and day care centres for senior citizens with dementia across Mumbai. "It's only now that a lot of schools and institutions are opening up to the concept of AAT", says Rohini. She says that when AAT is used, the change is fast.</i></p>
                            <p align="justify"><i><b>Pet Partners, an organisation in the US, has compiled a list of research studies on the health benefits of AAT:</b>

                            <p align="justify"><b>Quirky pet<br />My python and I</b><br /><i>The python is coiled around Raju's (name changed) neck. It is more than 10 feet long with the map of an unknown world patterning its torso. It looks vicious as it hisses with its scissored tongue. His wife, Sheila, hands him a roll of cello tape with which he seals the mouth of the python. Raju uncoils the python from his neck and lets it loose on the tiled floor. It slithers this way and that as the rest of us scuttle to the other corner of the room. It bends its neck—a sign that it's about to charge, says Raju. Sure enough, the next instant the snake strikes, scaring the bejesus out of the rest of us. This could be a scene straight out of the National Geographic.</i></p>
                            <p align="justify"><i>Raju has had a fascination for animals from a young age. Once upon a time, he had 13 species of animals, including falcons, flying ducks, mongooses and guinea pigs, in his house. Some years ago, he remembers a file of children from the nearby play school coming to his house to check out his mini zoo. "He would collect all the animals that others consider ugly", says Sheila. She remembers a scene right after their marriage when she discovered a small glass jar containing a live snake in their bedroom. She was petrified.</i></p>
                            <p align="justify"><i>"For him, the animals come first. The children and I are distant priorities", she says.
When Raju got the python 10 years ago, it was only four feet long. An acquaintance had handed over a heavy sack and asked him if he wanted to have it. Inside lay two pythons side by side. One of them escaped; the other, he took home. Pythons in Singapore and Thailand are let out in the open. For this reason, they are quite tame. Since he has kept his snake in a cage it is very aggressive. He lets it out only once or twice a month.</i></p>
                            <p align="justify"><i>Pythons are non-venomous. Among its members are some of the largest snakes in the world. They will generally not attack humans unless startled or provoked, although females protecting their eggs can become aggressive.</i></p>
                            <p align="justify"><i>Raju feeds his python once in two weeks. It is given either hens or parakeets. The prey is killed by a process called constriction. The snake coils around its prey and by applying pressure, prevents it from inhaling. The prey eventually succumbs to asphyxiation. Unlike other animals, pythons don't develop an attachment to their owners. "Pythons are dumb animals, but at the same time they're very unpredictable", says Raju.<br />Around town, Raju is known as the snake charmer. The entire neighbourhood contributes to the python's meals.</i></p>
