Use the button (bt-template.gif) and copy patterns (breadthwise) till the desired size is reached @96dpi
Magnify the button so that you can replace the topmost layer with the one below it (for buttons on the second line)
Put in the text as follows:
Arial Narrow
Regular
10
Strong
Orange (fe9e3e)
Make sure the images are saved as GIF files

On Photoshop CS5, I had to set it up as follows. 
Arial Narrow
Regular
7 pt
Vertical Scale 50%
Horizpontal Scale 45%
Crisp
Orange (fe9e3e)
Make sure the images are saved as GIF files

A good rule of thumb is to reproduce the text from another layer (prefereably in the same column), and then replace it with the new text.
