Such clients tend to see the therapist as more friendly if there is a therapy pet present in the room. This helps the therapist make a breakthrough. Having an animal present also serves as a strong motivator for continuing with the therapy.<br /><br />

Thus a therapy animal's warm and playful presence lowers anxiety and increases comfort levels in a client. This makes them more relaxed and co-operative in therapy.<br /><br />
                          <img border="0" src="/images/orange-paw.gif" alt="orange-paw bullet" align="absmiddle" width="12" height="12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Interaction with animals helps in bringing individuals out of their world into ours. This is especially useful for clients with Autism or psychiatric illnesses who are so involved in their own world that they do not pay much attention to the present situation. Having a dog nudging his nose into their hands or waiting eagerly for them to throw the ball makes them focus on the present. They start talking about the animal and watch him play rather than just thinking about themselves and their problems. Thus therapy animals encourage interaction between client-therapist and client - outside world.<br /><br />
                          <img border="0" src="/images/orange-paw.gif" alt="orange-paw bullet" align="absmiddle" width="12" height="12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Therapy animals have a way of accepting people without qualification. They don't care how a person looks or what they say. An animal's acceptance is non-judgmental and unconditional. When a client gets such unconditional love from an animal they give better responses during therapy.<br /><br />
                          <img border="0" src="/images/orange-paw.gif" alt="orange-paw bullet" align="absmiddle" width="12" height="12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a warm, furry animal to stroke and hug is therapeutic to clients who are not comfortable being touched by people.<br />

If a child can be taught to be empathetic towards animals, this then generalizes to their experiences with people.<br /><br 	/>
                          <img border="0" src="/images/orange-paw.gif" alt="orange-paw bullet" align="absmiddle" width="12" height="12">&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching a pet jump around and play can be relaxing and fun even to people who don't like animals. So the mere presence of a therapy pet can lighten the atmosphere in a room.<br /><br />
