Because of our therapy pets across the world, pets are driving big businesses for pet-friendly entrepreneurs. In India, the pet industry is currently valued at around Rs. 500 crore, growing at about 25 percent. And this isn’t even the tip of the iceberg, says Anupama Vinayak, founder of <a href="http://petvacations.in" target="_blank">PetVacations.in</a>. Only one in a 100 Indian homes has a pet, as opposed to one out of three in the United States. The potential for growth in this segment is undeniable, as these early movers will vouch for.</p>

Angel was the inspiration behind the organization’s name and was also its first therapy dog. Six months later, Fernandes was joined by her batch mate Radhika Nair as a co-founder, and the foundation was launched — with zero funding.</p>

Their clients range from age one to 95 years. “Animals are great motivators and are used, through various activities, [to help] children develop social, verbal and motor skills. A simple task like brushing a dog’s coat has proven to be a therapeutic remedy for several disorders; it has generated great results”, says Radhika Nair.</p>
